total five components 
c1,c2,c3,c4,c5 
c1 


sometime direct export won't work that time go to tradition way export defult

whenever using something inside curly bracket it can be js object or react component

add onne prop 


prop can be between components only by following hirachy which mean parent to child 
to overcome this with interms of efficiency we are using hooks

if we want to use state one component to another component only way to achieve is passing it props in the hiracy 

this is not efficient to make it efficient to exclusive hook "useContext" 

want four component 
first-app.js
second-container
thired - users  ----
                    |  
fourth - user   ---- 

useContext hook:
        without following a hirachy passing state one component to another component in efficient way using this hook

Two importm thing:
1.create context
2.use contex 	

in the given a example 
create context will be done in app component and use that will bne use in user component  using usecontext



syncroning a compoknent with and extranal system  after are action monitoring or cing this side effect happening in the functional component using useeffect 8


useReducer:
	
	same as useDState to manage or update states that is data that is values of components.
	difference is if u have more state or complex things u use usereducer hook
Step1:
	create inc dec programusing usesate 

step 2:
	replace usestate with use reducer
	
Point 1:

	useReducer take 2 arguments first is reducerfunction which says what you want to do (like inc or dec) second is initial value of state

Point 2:

	usereduce returns array with two values like usestate
	first is that initial count and second is dispatch function
	we call them as ----state and dispatch----

-----now this state will hold that initial value and updated 
once u call diuspatch function and dispatch trigger useReducer function
